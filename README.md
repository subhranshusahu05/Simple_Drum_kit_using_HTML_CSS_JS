# 🥁 Drum Kit

This is a fun **Drum Kit project** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to play drum sounds by either **clicking the buttons** or **pressing keys** on the keyboard.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Play different drum sounds using buttons (`w, a, s, d, j, k, l`).
- Use keyboard keys (`w, a, s, d, j, k, l`) to trigger the same sounds.
- **Button animation** effect when pressed or clicked.
- Styled with CSS and background images for a realistic drum look.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** → Page structure  
- **CSS** → Styling and button design  
- **JavaScript** → Sound playback, animations, and key handling  

---

## 🎹 How It Works
1. Each drum button is mapped to a specific sound file (e.g., `tom-1.mp3`, `snare.mp3`, `crash.mp3`).
2. When a button is clicked or a key is pressed, JavaScript plays the matching sound.
3. An animation highlights the active drum button for better user interaction.
